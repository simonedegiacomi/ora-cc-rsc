# EV3 (c4ev3) Launcher

This folder contains the source code of the launcher that executes programs generated by OpenRoberta using the c4ev3 robot plugin.

## Build the launcher

Set the LMS_ASSEMBLER variable in the `build.sh` script and then run it. LMS_ASSEMBLER should point to the folder that contains the lms compiler, which you can find in the source code of the EV3 firmware.
